           <p>Müsli (you can pronounce it like"MEWs-lee") is a dry mixture of grains, mainly oat and bran, and dried fruits like raisins and apple. It is also a dish in itself. Essentially, you can't make Müsli without müsli. It was invented by some Swiss guy, I guess. I recommend that you just pick up a sack of pre-made mix from the store, so long as it does not contain added sugar; we are going to make it sweet enough. If you don't want to buy it from a store, you can make your mixture with steel cut oats, raisins, bran flakes, flax seeds, hazelnuts, almond, dried apple, sunflower seeds, millet (if you like), and anything else that catches your fancy. Its really about how you like it. Regardless of how you come across your müsli, it's very tasty and an easy (enough) meal on a hot summer day.</p>

           <h3>Steps:</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Get out a big bowl. Like the next size up from a cereal bowl, but not the big-ass bowl you save the cookie dough in.</li>
               <li>Pull out the fruit you want in your Müsli from the fridge (I am assuming it's in the fridge)</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Ask yourself if you're really going to eat all of that.</li>
                   <li>Ask yourself if that's actually enough fruit, or do you need more?</li>
                   <li>They say "less is more," but with Müsli, more is more. Get out that orange you were saving for some reason. It's about to go down now.</li>
               </ul>
               <li>Cut soft fruits into small chunks, and place in your bowl.</li>
               <li>(Optional) Grate, rather than chop, the apple and pears into the bowl.</li>
               <li>Grate the ginger on your finest grater (bonus if you have an oroshiki) into the bowl.</li>
               <li>Gently stir up the fruit mixture.</li>
               <li>Dump as much grain as you think you are going to eat (recommended 1 to 2 cups) into the bowl.</li>
               <li>Take a couple giant spoonfuls of yogurt, and sploot them into the bowl.</li>
               <li>Stir up mixture, and ask yourself if you want it more fluid.</li>
               <li>If you <em>do</em> want it more fluid, add a splash of milk</li>
               <li>How much do you love cinnamon? I personally love it, so I dump a fair amount into the mix, while my partner looks at me like I am insane. Add as much as you think you want.</li>
               <li>(Optional) You can add a spoonful of sugar or a small packet of vanilla sugar if you like; personally, I'm happy without.</li>
               <li>Mix it all up, and shovel it into your mouth.</li>
               <li>Enjoy!</li>

           <p>I personally enjoy a fried egg with a crispy underside and runny yolk. Runny does not mean slimy; there is a difference. Slimy is when you didn't cook the egg white through. Runny means you didn't butcher the yolk. You can dip bread into it, rub you hashbrowns into it (if you have hashbrowns), all kinds of good stuff. This is the way I like my eggs. You do it the way you want.</p>
           <p>Additionally, in this recipe, I recommend the use of Aromat, which is a product made by Knorr. It is a savory salt with a slight boullion flavor, and it might not be available everywhere. You might find it in a specialty store. Keep an eye out for it; it's pretty tasty.</p>

           <h3>Steps:</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Get out a pan that will accommodate the number of eggs you are making, and start it heating on the stove, generally at the medium to low heat.</li>
               <li>As your pan heats up, drizzle some olive oil into the pan. Nope! Not that much! What are you trying to do, <em>drown</em> it?!</li>
               <li>Well, grab a paper towel, and use the corner to pull some of that out of the pan. Don't worry about it; we can salvage this.</li>
               <li>Take your pan off the heat for a second, and swirl the oil around. If the oil moves fluidly, like water, it's hot enough.</li>
               <li>Crack you egg (or eggs, maybe the whole carton) into the pan.</li>
               <li>If the egg white immediately becomes opaque, your heat might be too high. If the egg white doesn't change opacity at all, your heat might be too low. It should start getting cloudy right away.</li>
               <li>Sprinkle your Aromat over the eggs (I like to put a liberal amount on the yolk) without over-salting it.</li>
               <li>Crack as much pepper as you can stand on that bad boy.</li>
               <li>Take a spatula and run the edge through the thicker portions of egg white that are probably still pretty slimy. It's okay if you break the bottom of the egg white to allow it to ooze out; it'll heal.</li>
               <li>Sprinkle out the curry powder all over that egg. You do not need to create some weird, dry crust or anything, but you can get generous with it.</li>
               <li>If you like, you can tap out a little smoked paprika for color and kicks over the whole thing.</li>
               <li>You are not going to flip this egg. Don't even worry about it.</li>
               <li>When your egg is ready, you should be able to jiggle the pan handle, and the only thing that moves with the agitation will be the yolk itself. If any part of the egg white moves, then it's not quite cooked through.</li>
               <li>Once your egg meets that exacting criteria, it's ready. Slide those little ovum onto a plate, and cut yourself a slice of Zopf.</li>
               <li>Enjoy!</li>

                <li>Add the cold milk, beaten egg, and yeast mixture to the melted butter.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the flour, stirring and mixing with a spatula as you go. Make sure to scrape the pockets of flour hiding at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir the mixture until the wet ingredients have been adequately absorbed in with the flour, and it's starting to look like dough.</li>
                <li>When the moment feels right, scrape the dough onto the counter and begin kneading.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the dough feels really wet and sticky, you can add a sprinkle of extra flour to help it along as you knead.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Knead the dough for ten full minutes. Get in there with those fingers and dig, twist, beat, and K! to the N! to the E! A! D!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: The dough should feel soft with a lot of body and give, not sticky (too wet), not hard (too dry).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Place dough into a large bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and place it in a warm, dry place for 40 minutes (or until it's doubled in size).</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 deg. Celsius (400 deg. Farenheit).</li>
                <li>Spread a thin dusting of flour over the workspace and pull out the dough.</li>
                <li>Cut dough into four equal parts.</li>
                <li>Roll each quarter into a long strand about 1 meter (3 feet) long.</li>
                <li>Take two dough strands, and place one over the other to form an 'X.'</li>
                <li>Create the four-strand braid</li>
                <ul>
                    I am terrible at explaining this, but I will do my best...
                    <li>Upper left strand over bottom left, down to center.</li>
                    <li>Bottom right to upper left.</li>
                    <li>Bottom left over center, to bottom right.</li>
                    <li>Top right over bottom right, down to center.</li>
                    <li>Continue. It takes  practice if you don't already know how to make a four-strand braid.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once your braid is formed, pinch off the end and place it on a sheet of baking paper.</li>
                <li>Make the other braided loaf.</li>
                <li>Place the second loaf onto the baking paper
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: I like to place them in alternating orientation for better spacing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Remember that other beaten egg I told you about in the ingredients list? Well now its time has come! Get that egg out, beat it, and add the pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Brush a gloss of egg over each braid. I try to make sure that every visible inch of the dough is covered.</li>
                <li>Wait about 10 minutes, and then add a second coat of egg gloss over the loaves.</li>
                <li>Pop the loaves into the pre-heated oven, and let them bake for about 30-35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Use the 'tap test' to see if the loaf is ready.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 'tap test' means, tap the bottom of the loaf. It should fell crisp and firm, and sound hollow. Tap the top of the loaf, and it should keep its shape; no squishing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When you are reasonably certain your bread is ready, pull the loaves out of the oven and place them on a cooling tray.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
